# @clevercanyon/preact-iso.fork

This is a fork of the original [preact-iso](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact-iso) on NPM. This fork has been modified in several ways and is no longer a drop-in replacement for the original package. The API has been improved and bugs have been fixed in the inbuilt router to allow for server-side prerendering; i.e., where `window.location` does not exist.
